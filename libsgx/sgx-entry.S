/**
 * Entry point for enclave calls.
 *
 * Upon entry we are still running with the user-level stack and the
 * x86_64 CPU control unit has stashed the user-level RIP in
 *
 * The first thing this function does is generate a partial stack frame
 * containing all caller-saved registers. The handler function
 * is responsible for saving all callee-saved registers. If it is a C
 * function, callee-saved registers are saved automatically by the compiler.
 *
 * Immediately before calling encalve main function, the enclave stack
 * looks like the following.  All fields represent the saved state of the
 * calling user-level task:
 *
 *            UNDEF      = Undefined, normally holds user-space SS
 *            UNDEF      = Undefined, normally holds user-space RSP
 *            UNDEF      = Undefined, normally holds user-space RFLAGS
 *            UNDEF      = Undefined, normally holds user-space CS
 *            RIP        = user-space RIP
 *            (junk)     = normally RAX, but RAX clobbered by EENTER
 *            RDI        = ARG0, passed from user-space
 *            RSI        = ARG1, passed from user-space
 *            RDX        = ARG2, passed from user-space
 *            (junk)     = normally RCX, but RCX is clobbered by EENTER
 *            RAX        = system call number, passed from user-space
 *            R8         = ARG4, passed from user-space
 *            R9         = ARG5, passed from user-space
 *            R10        = ARG3, passed from user-space
 *     RSP -> R11        = user-space RFLAGS
 *
 * And the registers are setup as follows:
 *
 *            RDI        = ARG0
 *            RSI        = ARG1
 *            RDX        = ARG2
 *            RCX        = ARG3 (was stored on R10 on entry)
 *            R8         = ARG4
 *            R9         = ARG5
 *
 * NOTE: RCX, RBX, and RAX are clobbered by system calls. This is due to 
 *       the ENCLS using EAX to store EENTER, RBX to store the TCS address,
 *       and RCX to store the AEP before transfering control to the kernel. 
 *       User-level will observe different values of RAX, RBX, and RCX after 
 *       EENTER than before.
 * 
 * C Prototype:
 *       int enclave_start(void);

	 * Enter from user-space - entry RSP/RBP are saved in the SSA by EENTER
	 * Just need to switch to a trusted stack, building up %rsp to point to

	 * that we can't actually read what's in the TCS on real hardware, the
	 * code/data is between us and the SSA in the GT/KAIST TCS/code/SSA/Heap
	 * layout. If each SSA area is placed next to it's SSA, on the other hand,
         * it would be easier to find the stack (and the heap!).
	 *
	 * Right now what we do assumes the TCS is readable, which it is in
 	 * simulator. As a result we can find the enclave base using the entry 
	 * offset in the TCS, and then the SSA from there. The other alternative
